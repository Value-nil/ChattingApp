Make all the GUI
Provide interfaces for the gui, then work on the networking
create fifo at home directory(with all conversations)

message structure for daemon:
short: can take the values of 0, 1 and 2, used to check if the message comes from the fifo, from a peer or from a udp socket, respectively
short: the protocol to be done
char*(11) the sending peer
uid_t: to indicate daemon the app has been opened(NOT WITH MESSAGE SENDING)
char*(11) the reciving peer
char*(101) message sent
for char*, allocate one more for null terminator

make sure all of the messages are sent FROM THE BEGINING

Actual to do:
-(DONE)For processing udp message, make sure you make a new tcp socket instead of using the listening socket
-(DONE)When listening tcp socket accepts connections, make sure to associate address to new peer(file des)
-(DONE)Set all tcp sockets to SO_REUSEADDR (OR) Set different port for connecting/listening sockets
-(DONE)Implement local IDs for sending targeted UDPs
-(DONE)Check code for making sure daemon takes into account conversions between different ports
-(DONE)Check code for placing operator delete where needed

-(DONE)Check desktop app(code review)
-(DONE)Final code review for daemon
-(DONE)Do main app directories
-(DONE)Reformat sending message from app
-(DONE)Reformat processing messages on app
-(Should be fine)Check if app handles different users on same device
-(DONE)Implement if daemon checks for opened fifos(in case they aren't opened)

-Test the app

FIXING APP:
-(DONE)Tell mainApp about new peers
-(DONE)Fix more sockets than expected and hunged up
-(DONE)Fix invalid pointer error when daemon closes
-(DONE)Adapt .xml file in app
-(DONE)Fix app not placing button on app
-(DONE)Send current available peers when opened application
-(DONE)Make types to replace large names(for more readability)
-(DONE)Change addressToFd key type to non-pointer
-(DONE)Change code to use non-pointer type in addrToFd
-(DONE)Make 2 fifos instead of 1
-(DONE)Fix segmentation fault


AFTER IT WORKS:
-(DONE)Fix daemon closing fifo(cannot reopen app)
-(DONE)Change message sending to allocate memory with dynamic size
-(semi-done)Handle device leaving network(being switched off)
-(DONE)Create directory for .xml file
-(DONE)Handle instalation of app
-(DONE)Consider changing protocol for dedicating a number to peer leaving(contact, not device)
-(DONE)Make a debug log

-Fix messages sometimes occupying all of the box space
-When processing input text, take into account newline insertions in locations that are different from end of string
-Implementing messages and contacts saving
-Tell FIFO about new contacts that are requesting(not a priority)
    --Handle someone requesting your contact(send notification)



Branch last objectives:
-Add signal handler for sigterm, to send contacts leaving message
-Make locally-sended messages appear
